Hazelcast support for MyBatis Cache

This module contains two cache implementations utilizing Hazelcast: 


1) org.mybatis.caches.hazelcast.HazelcastCache:

Use "org.mybatis.caches.hazelcast.HazelcastCache" if you want the JVM running MyBatis to be part of the Hazelcast cache cluster.

Internally this is calling "Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance()".


2) org.mybatis.caches.hazelcast.HazelcastClientCache:

Use "org.mybatis.caches.hazelcast.HazelcastClientCache" if you want the JVM running MyBatis to be a client to a Hazelcast cache cluster running outside the JVM running MyBatis.

Internally this is calling "HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient()". Also see http://hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html/nativeclient.html
